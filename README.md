# Spring SOAP Web Service Example

This project is a **Spring Boot SOAP Web Service** implemented by following the official [Spring.io guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/producing-web-service).  
I completed this tutorial independently to learn about SOAP web services, WSDL exposure, and JAXB schema-based contract generation.

---

## üìö Overview

This application:

‚úÖ Exposes a SOAP endpoint to fetch country details (name, population, capital, currency).  
‚úÖ Generates Java classes from an XSD schema (`countries.xsd`) using JAXB.  
‚úÖ Publishes a WSDL for client consumption.

---

## üõ† Technologies Used

- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.x
- Spring Web Services
- JAXB
- Maven
- SOAP UI / cURL for testing

---

## üß© Project Structure

```plaintext
src/
  main/
    java/
      com.soap.tutorial.app.producingwebservice/
        CountryEndpoint.java                  # Handles incoming SOAP requests
        CountryRepository.java                # Contains country data
        WebServiceConfig.java                 # Configures SOAP servlet and WSDL
        ProducingWebServiceApplication.java   # Main app entry point
    resources/
      countries.xsd                           # XML Schema Definition
      application.properties


‚∏ª

üåê Running the Application

1Ô∏è‚É£ Build and run the service:

mvn clean spring-boot:run

The service will start on:

http://localhost:8080


‚∏ª

üìù WSDL Location

Once running, the WSDL is available at:

http://localhost:8080/ws/countries.wsdl

This WSDL describes the SOAP operations and schema for clients.

‚∏ª

üöÄ Testing the Service

Using cURL

Create a request.xml file with the following content:

<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
                  xmlns:gs="http://spring.io/guides/gs-producing-web-service">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <gs:getCountryRequest>
         <gs:name>Spain</gs:name>
      </gs:getCountryRequest>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>

Run this command to send the request:

curl --header "Content-Type: text/xml" --data @request.xml http://localhost:8080/ws

You will receive a SOAP response containing the country details.

‚∏ª

Using SOAP UI
	1.	Create a new SOAP Project.
	2.	Enter the WSDL URL:

http://localhost:8080/ws/countries.wsdl


	3.	Create a request for the getCountry operation.
	4.	Fill the request body with the sample XML above.
	5.	Click Submit to get the response.
